# DMCA-transaction-router
Decentralized Multi-Chain Accelerator - platform for optimizing blockchain transactions through multi-chain routing, integration of Layer-2 technologies, and built-in security modules.


**Description:**
DMCA-transaction-router is a platform for optimizing transactions on blockchains using additional multi-lane routing, integration of Layer-2 technologies and providing additional security for automated audits.

**Main functions:**
- Find information about the blockchain-merezh camp (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC etc.).
- Analysis of commissions, confirmation and importance of measures.
- Select the optimal route for the transaction.
- Integration with API/oracles to retrieve current data.

**Stream status:**
The project is at the MVP development stage.

# DMCA Transaction Router

**Slogan:** "Optimizing Transactions of the Future"  
**Vision:** To create a unified platform for fast, low-cost, and secure transactions across multiple blockchain networks.

## Overview

The **DMCA Transaction Router** is a decentralized multi-chain accelerator that optimizes transaction routing across various blockchain networks. It dynamically selects the best network for executing a transaction based on key parameters such as gas fee, confirmation time, network load, average block time, and reliability.

## Features

- **Multi-Chain Support:**  
  Routes transactions across Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Avalanche, and Solana.
- **Dynamic Network Selection:**  
  Uses real-time data from APIs (Etherscan, Polygonscan, BscScan) to calculate a "score" for each network and selects the optimal one.
- **Testnet Integration:**  
  Supports sending transactions via ethers.js on test networks (e.g., Sepolia).
- **Secure Configuration:**  
  Environment variables are used to securely store API keys and other sensitive data.
- **CI/CD:**  
  Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions and Heroku.
- **Future Expansion:**  
  Plans to integrate partner APIs, add advanced monitoring, and introduce monetization models.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Blockchain Interaction:** ethers.js
- **APIs:** Etherscan, Polygonscan, BscScan (and estimated data for Avalanche and Solana)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Deployment:** Heroku
- **Security:** Helmet, express-validator

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
